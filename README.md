# 🤖 3D Robot Game Using Blender 2.79

This is a simple interactive 3D game created using Blender 2.79 and the Blender Game Engine (BGE). The player can control a robot that moves in different directions and shoots projectiles. The project includes a basic main menu and an FPS-style camera system.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The goal of this project is to learn how to create a basic robot game using Blender 2.79, covering key aspects such as:

- 3D Modeling
- Texturing & Materials
- Animation
- Game Logic Implementation
- Interactive Menu System

## 🛠 Main Features

- **Robot Movement:** Move forward, backward, turn left & right.
- **Shooting Mechanism:** Shoot a projectile (sphere) forward.
- **Main Menu:** Simple UI with Start and Quit options.
- **First-Person Camera:** Camera follows behind the robot.
- **Game Export:** Can be exported and played without opening Blender.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Blender 2.79
- Blender Game Engine (BGE)
- Logic Bricks (Sensor, Controller, Actuator)
- UV Mapping & Rigid Body Physics

## 📦 Project Structure

- `robot_game.blend` – Main Blender game file.
- `manual_book.pdf` – Step-by-step game creation documentation.

## 📄 Documentation

The included manual explains how to:
- Model and texture the robot
- Set up movement and shooting logic using logic bricks
- Configure the camera system
- Design the main menu interface
- Export the game using "Save as Game Engine Runtime"

## ⚠️ Note

Blender Game Engine (BGE) has been removed in versions after 2.79. Make sure to use **Blender 2.79** to run this project properly.
